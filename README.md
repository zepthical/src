## Definition of "Skid"

The term **"skid"**, a colloquial abbreviation of **"script kiddie"**, is pejoratively employed within software development, cybersecurity, and exploit development communities. It denotes an individual who appropriates pre-existing code, scripts, or utilities—often created by more proficient developers—without possessing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying logic or mechanisms.

Rather than engaging in genuine problem-solving, algorithmic design, or software architecture, such individuals typically engage in superficial modifications to existing codebases for the purpose of misrepresentation or personal gain. This conduct is widely regarded as antithetical to the principles of intellectual integrity, technical competency, and open-source collaboration.

This repository explicitly advocates for originality, continuous learning, and ethical development practices. All contributors are encouraged to cultivate a deep understanding of the code they write and to avoid the uncritical replication of others’ work without attribution or comprehension.


So do not be a skid.
